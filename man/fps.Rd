\title{Full pattern summation}
\usage{
fps(lib, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{lib}{A \code{powdRlib} object representing the reference library. Created using the
\code{powdRlib} constructor function.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to methods e.g. \code{fps.powdRlib}}
}
\value{
a list with components:
\item{tth}{a vector of the 2theta scale of the fitted data}
\item{fitted}{a vector of the fitted XRPD pattern}
\item{measured}{a vector of the original XRPD measurement (aligned)}
\item{residuals}{a vector of the residuals (fitted vs measured)}
\item{phases}{a dataframe of the phases used to produce the fitted pattern}
\item{phases_summary}{the phases dataframe grouped by phase_name and summarised (sum)}
\item{rwp}{the Rwp of the fitted vs measured pattern}
\item{weighted_pure_patterns}{a dataframe of reference patterns used to produce the fitted pattern.
All patterns have been weighted according to the coefficients used in the fit}
\item{coefficients}{a named vector of coefficients used to produce the fitted pattern}
}
\description{
\code{fps} returns estimates of phase concentrations using full pattern
summation of X-ray powder diffraction data. For more details see \code{?fps.powdRlib}.
}
\details{
Applies full pattern summation (Chipera & Bish, 2002, 2013; Eberl, 2003) to an XRPD
measurement to quantify phase concentrations. Requires a \code{powdRlib} library of
reference patterns with pre-measured reference intensity ratios in order to derive
mineral concentrations.
}
\examples{
#Load the minerals library
data(minerals)

# Load the soils data
data(soils)

#Since the reference library is relatively small,
#the whole library can be used at once to get an
#estimate of the phases within each sample.
